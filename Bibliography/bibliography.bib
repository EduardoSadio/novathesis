@article{Goal_Based_Shared_Decision_Making,
   abstract = {OBJECTIVE Definitions of shared decision-making (SDM) have largely neglected to consider goal setting as an explicit component. Applying SDM to people with multiple long-term conditions requires attention to goal setting. We propose an integrated model, which shows how goal setting, at 3 levels, can be integrated into the 3-talk SDM model. METHOD The model was developed by integrating 2 published models. RESULTS An integrated, goal-based SDM model is proposed and applied to a patient with multiple, complex, long-term clinical conditions to illustrate the use of a visualization tool called a Goal Board. A Goal Board prioritizes collaborative goals and aligns goals with interventional options. CONCLUSION The model provides an approach to achieve person-centered decision-making by not only eliciting and prioritizing goals but also by aligning prioritized goals and interventions. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS Further research is required to evaluate the utility of the proposed model.},

@article{Stroke_Survivors,
   abstract = {Background and Purpose: Patients and caregivers have not typically been involved in the selection of a post-acute care (PAC) provider. In 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed the need to involve patients and their families during discharge planning. Engaging patients in rehabilitation decisions encourages shared decision making among patients and their clinicians. The purpose of this study was to examine stroke survivors' perspectives on their involvement in selecting a PAC provider and their goal setting and their satisfaction with the rehabilitation stay and their discharge advice for stroke survivors, prior to 2015. Methods: This qualitative study utilized semistructured interviews. Thematic content analysis was performed on interviews involving 18 stroke survivors (mean age = 68 years) related to their involvement in planning for their inpatient rehabilitation facility or skilled nursing facility stay, goal setting, and discharge needs. Results: More than half the participants were not involved in the selection of their PAC setting and believed that doctors made these decisions. Around two-fifths of stroke survivors reported that they were not involved in rehabilitation goal setting. Most patients were satisfied with their rehabilitation stay. When asked to recommend discharge topics for other stroke survivors, participants recommended additional information on health care services, interventions, and insurance coverage. Discussion and Conclusion: Despite recommendations to include stroke patients in PAC selection and goal setting, many former inpatient rehabilitation facility and skilled nursing facility patients report not being involved in either aspect of care.

@article{Goal_setting_in_physiotherapy_exploring_a_person_centered_perspective,
   abstract = {Objective: To analyze definitions and related requirements, processes, and operationalization of person-centered goal-setting in the physiotherapy research literature; to discuss those findings in relation to underlying principles of person-centeredness; and to provide an initial framework for how person-centered goal-setting could be conceptualized and operationalized in physiotherapy. Methods: A literature search was conducted in the databases: CINAHL, PubMed, PEDro, PsycINFO, REHABdata and Scopus. A content analysis was performed on how person-centered goal-setting was described. Results: A total of 21 articles were included in the content analysis. Five categories were identified: 1) Understanding goals that are meaningful to the patients; 2) Setting goals in collaboration; 3) Facing challenges with person-centered goal-setting; 4) Developing skills by experiences and education; and 5) Changing interaction and reflective practice. These categories were abstracted into two higher-ordered interlaced themes: 1) To seek mutual understanding of what is meaningful to the patient; and 2) To refine physiotherapy interaction skills, which we suggest would be useful for further conceptualization. Conclusion: In this analysis, we interpreted person-centered goal-setting in physiotherapy as a process of interaction toward a mutual understanding of what is meaningful to the patient. Future research may explore how to integrate mindful listening, embodied interaction and continuous ethical reflection with different assessments and treatment methods.},

   abstract = {Objectives Physiotherapists are encouraged to set goals together with their patients to deliver client-centred care. In practice however, this goal-setting process is poorly specified, with limited patient involvement. The Patient-Specific Complaints instrument (PSC) can support the goal-setting process. Despite its being frequently used by Dutch physiotherapists, its actual role in goal setting is unknown. The objective was to examine physiotherapy goal-setting and the use of the PSC within this process, as well as the physiotherapists' perception of the usefulness of the PSC. Methods Consultations between physiotherapists and patients were observed and physiotherapists were interviewed. Data were analysed by directed content analysis, using a goal-setting framework as the coding scheme whose phases include: goal negotiation, goal setting, planning, and appraisal and feedback. Results The patients' problems were comprehensively explored, with the PSC focussing on activity problems. Goal-setting and planning phases were poorly specified and mainly physiotherapist-led. The physiotherapists appreciated the PSC for patient involvement during goal negotiation and evaluation. Its perceived usefulness for goal setting and planning ranged from useful for tailoring goals to the patient's needs to not useful at all. One major reason to use it was meeting external audit obligations. Conclusions There are some discrepancies between how physiotherapists use the PSC and how they perceived its usefulness. Physiotherapists did use the PSC in a goal-setting process, though often as a standalone tool without integration in the whole physiotherapy process, and with limited patient involvement. In this way, its full potential for goal setting is not utilized.},

@misc{Laver2010,
   abstract = {Goal setting is recommended both in the acute and rehabilitation phases after stroke, yet this presents multiple challenges for patients and clinicians. The aim of this study was to describe the participants' readiness and ability to set goals over time. METHODS: Fifteen stroke survivors aged 18-70 yrs were interviewed using a semi-struc-tured interview guide at three time points: on the acute stroke unit, while participating in a subacute rehabilitation program, and 6 mos after the stroke. Content analysis was performed using NVivo. RESULTS: Participants had difficulty setting goals early after stroke. Contributing to this was limited understanding of goal terminology, wanting to "get back to normal," differences in readiness to set goals, and poor knowledge about typical stroke recovery. CONCLUSION: Future models need to acknowledge the importance of timing and education in goal setting. People who have just had a stroke need time to understand many of the terms and concepts that treating cli-nicians use, and new models need to acknowledge the importance of health literacy if both patients and carers are to participate in the rehabilitation process. People that have had a stroke have an important role to play in the development of these new models. J Allied Health 2010; 39:e149-e154. STROKE IS ONE of the leading causes of disease and disability in the world. 1,2 While people that have had a stroke generally experience recovery in the months after stroke 3 about half of these people report ongoing disability 4. Reduced quality of life is also commonly reported many years after the stroke 5. Early engagement in rehabilitation is considered ideal 6 ; however, many patients find it difficult to deal with sudden dependency and to engage immediately with recovery strategies 7. Goal setting has been described as an essential component of any rehabilitation program 8. Guidelines 9-12 state that the person with stroke should be actively involved in setting rehabilitation goals. These recommendations are often based on expert opinion rather than on available evidence. A recent systematic review (including 19 randomised controlled trials) found that while there was some evidence that goal setting led to increased patient adherence to rehabilitation programs , there was inconsistent evidence that it improved health related outcomes (as determined by standardised outcome measures) 8. Despite the lack of evidence from quantitative studies, several qualitative studies have found that patients regard col-laborative goal setting positively; patients report goal setting provides them with information, empowerment, ownership of treatment, focus and confidence 13-15. Clinicians also report that goal setting is important, enabling them to develop a better understanding of the patient and individualise treatment 16,17. Investigation of goal setting in clinical settings however, has revealed that collaborative goal setting occurs infrequently and patients have difficulty expressing goals 18-20. The time needed to adjust to a major health event, the lack of knowledge that patients' have about typical recovery and the passive role assigned to patients in a hospital setting may contribute to this 7,14,15,19. Clinicians also report that goal setting can challenge the therapeutic relationship when there is a discrepancy between whether patients and clinicians believe the goals are realistic 13. Some authors have suggested that providing clinicians with additional training in goal setting techniques would improve the quality of goal setting in clinical practice 16. However, there is little research to support this tenet. Furthermore, the clinician's years of clinical experience have not been shown to translate into improved patient participation in goal setting 18,21. In summary, while qualitative studies suggest that goal setting is positively regarded by patients and clinicians, the process can be problematic and in clinical practice goals are infrequently set. While there are several approaches to goal setting 22 , it is recognised that in clinical practice goals are often developed using an informal or 'problem oriented' approach 23. Alternative models of goal setting describe a 'motivational' stage which occurs prior to setting goals 24. This phase allows time},

@article{Is_independence_enough,
   abstract = {Purpose: This discussion paper argues that holding independence as the central goal for rehabilitation has limitations that hinder successful outcomes. It shows why autonomy and social engagement should also serve as goals of rehabilitation, in order to achieve quality of life and effective functioning. Methods: The paper reviews problems arising from the over-emphasis on independence in rehabilitation. Although independence is a valuable goal on some tasks, it is sometimes not possible or desirable and is best complimented by autonomy and social engagement. Autonomy recognises that enacting some goals requires the support of other people. Autonomy is thus linked to social engagement (connectivity) in the workplace and personal relationships. The paper applies this framework to motor and cognitive disabilities. Results: The inclusion of autonomy and social engagement as goals for rehabilitation addresses the limitations of independence and can serve the unifying aim of enhancing the person’s quality of life. These goals apply equally to motor disabilities and the cognitive and behavioural effects of injuries which affect personal and work relationships. Conclusions: Rehabilitation is likely to be more effective if it aims at a combination of independence, autonomy and social engagement, in service of the goal of a good quality of life.},

@article{Experiences_of_self_management_support_following_a_stroke,
   abstract = {Background Supporting self-management in stroke patients improves psychological and functional outcomes but evidence on how to achieve this is sparse. We aimed to synthesise evidence from systematic reviews of qualitative studies in an overarching meta-review to inform the delivery and development of self-management support interventions. Methods We systematically searched eight electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL for qualitative systematic reviews (published January 1993 to June 2012). We included studies exploring patientsâ€™, carersâ€™ or health care professionalsâ€™ experiences relevant to self-management support following a stroke, including studies describing the lived experience of surviving a stroke. We meta-synthesised the included review findings using a meta-ethnographic framework. Results Seven reviews, reporting 130 unique studies, were included. Themes emerging from the reviews were pertinent, consistent and showed data saturation; though explicit mention of self-management support was rare. Our meta-review highlighted the devastating impact of stroke on patientsâ€™ self-image; the varying needs for self-management support across the trajectory of recovery; the need for psychological and emotional support throughout recovery particularly when physical recovery plateaus; the considerable information needs of patients and carers which also vary across the trajectory of recovery; the importance of good patient-professional communication; the potential benefits of goal-setting and actionplanning; and the need for social support which might be met by groups for stroke survivors. Conclusions The observed data saturation suggests that, currently, no further qualitative research simply describing the lived experience of stroke is needed; we propose that it would be more useful to focus on qualitative research informing self-management support interventions and their implementation. Our findings demonstrate both the on-going importance of self-management support and the evolving priorities throughout the stages of recovery following a stroke. The challenge now is to ensure these findings inform routine practice and the development of interventions to support self-management amongst stroke survivors.},

@article{Building_Bridges_between_healthcare_professionals_patients_and_families,
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Programmes providing self-management support for patients and families are gaining attention and have shown promising outcomes with regards to reducing long-term unmet needs post stroke. However, notions of what good self-management support looks like can differ depending on professional opinion, individual preferences, skills and experiences of patients and their families as well as on how care and rehabilitation is organised in a particular healthcare setting. This resonates with the perspective of patient-centred care, according to which the meaning of good care is not universal, but rather jointly shaped between healthcare professionals and patients in everyday interactions. While self-management support is continuously co-produced in care and rehabilitation practices, most self-management programmes are typically provided as an 'add-on' to existing statutory care. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to deepen the understanding of how self-management support can be made an integral part of everyday care and rehabilitation using Bridges methodology. METHODS: The authors provide a self-reflective account on 'Bridges' an integrated approach to self-management support, which is used by healthcare professionals within acute and community stroke rehabilitation across the UK, and in some parts of New Zealand and Australia. RESULTS: Bridges is based on self-efficacy principles, but has a central aim of professionals sharing decision-making and expertise with patients and families in every healthcare interaction. Methodologically, the co-production of a Bridges support package with local healthcare professionals and patients is critical. The authors present the values articulated by the support package and how it engages professionals, patients and Bridges training facilitators in a continuous process of adjusting and re-adjusting situated self-management support practices. CONCLUSIONS: Our reflections reveal the need to consider development and implementation of self-management support as one and the same on-going process, if we are to facilitate successful engagement and interest from healthcare professionals as well as their patients and families.},

Yet, published data show that the evidence is not so straightforward or easy to evaluate. The majority of the hard evidence, however, does imply that stroke patients benefit from rehabilitation with physiotherapy. This benefit may be statistically small, but for a given individual, it could mean the difference between living at home or in an institution. Few studies address the question of the optimal physiotherapy in stroke rehabilitation. The evidence available today suggests that it does not matter which form of treatment is chosen and that any of the available approaches will improve the patient's functional status. In other words, if an optimal treatment exists, we have, so far, failed to identify it. Until further evidence emerges, we should therefore select therapies that are most cost-effective and that can be given to the largest number of patients. Well-planned clinical trials aimed at finding the best approach and discriminating potential responders from nonresponders are urgently needed. © 1990 American Heart Association, Inc.},

@article{ Stroke,
   abstract = {Stroke is a clinically defined syndrome of acute, focal neurological deficit attributed to vascular injury (infarction, haemorrhage) of the central nervous system. Stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Stroke is not a single disease but can be caused by a wide range of risk factors, disease processes and mechanisms. Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for stroke, although its contribution differs for different subtypes. Most (85%) strokes are ischaemic, predominantly caused by small vessel arteriolosclerosis, cardioembolism and large artery athero-thromboembolism. Ischaemic strokes in younger patients can result from a different spectrum of causes such as extracranial dissection. Approximately 15% of strokes worldwide are the result of intracerebral haemorrhage, which can be deep (basal ganglia, brainstem), cerebellar or lobar. Deep haemorrhages usually result from deep perforator (hy-pertensive) arteriopathy (arteriolosclerosis), while lobar haemorrhages are mainly caused by cerebral amyloid angiopathy or arteriolosclero-sis. A minority (about 20%) of intracerebral haemorrhages are caused by macrovascular lesions (vascular malformations, aneurysms, caverno-mas), venous sinus thrombosis or rarer causes; these are particularly important in young patients (<50 years). Knowledge of vascular and ce-rebral anatomy is important in localizing strokes and understanding their mechanisms. This guides rational acute management, investigation, and secondary prevention.},
