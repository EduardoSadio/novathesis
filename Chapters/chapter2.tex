\subsection{Definition}
\label{sec:definitionStroke}
The abrupt onset of a localized neurological deficit caused by a vascular source is the clinical state known as a stroke. This illness is caused by either an internal blood vessel rupture (hemorrhagic stroke) or an obstruction of blood flow to the brain (ischemic stroke). Stroke has a substantial socioeconomic impact and is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide~\cite{Stroke}.

\subsection{Signs and symptoms}
\label{sec:signsandsymptoms}
The portion of the brain affected by a stroke can change the symptoms (see Figure~\ref{fig:Symptoms}). Nonetheless, typical symptoms consist of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Abrupt Weakness or Numbness:} Especially affecting the face, arm, or leg, and usually on one side of the body.
  \item \textbf{Confusion:} Difficulty speaking or understanding speech.
  \item \textbf{Visual Issues:} An abrupt difficulty seeing with one or both eyes.
  \item \textbf{Dizziness and Loss of Coordination:} Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, and loss of balance or coordination.
  \item \textbf{Severe Headache:} An abrupt, intense headache without a recognized reason.
\end{itemize}
Additional symptoms may include difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking or understanding, abrupt, violent vomiting, or altered awareness~\cite{Stroke,Epidemiologyofstroke}.

  \caption{Areas of the brain affected by a stroke and the specific functions they control~\cite{OverviewofStroke}}\label{fig:Symptoms}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Types of Strokes}
\label{sec:typesofstrokes}
Strokes are broadly classified into two main types: ischemic and hemorrhagic, with a third type, transient ischemic attack (TIA), considered a warning sign.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Ischemic Stroke:}
  As mentioned by Andrei V. Alexandrov and Balaji Krishnaiah~\cite{IschemicStroke}, ``An ischemic stroke typically results from blockage of an artery that supplies blood to the brain, most commonly a branch of one of the internal carotid arteries. As a result, brain cells are deprived of blood. Most brain cells die if they are deprived of blood for 4.5 hours`` (see Figure~\ref{fig:Ischemic_Stroke}). 
  

  Ischemic strokes are further classified into several subtypes based on their etiology~\cite{Stroke}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Large Artery Atherosclerosis:} Caused by thrombus formation in atherosclerotic vessels, leading to vessel occlusion.
    \item \textbf{Cardioembolic Stroke:} Caused by emboli originating from the heart, often due to atrial fibrillation or other cardiac abnormalities.
    \item \textbf{Small Vessel Occlusion (Lacunar Stroke):} Results from the occlusion of small, penetrating arteries that supply deep brain structures.
    \item \textbf{Cryptogenic Stroke:} An ischemic stroke for which a definitive cause cannot be found despite intensive testing. 
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Ischemic_Stroke}
    \caption{ Illustration of an ischaemic stroke, showing the formation of a blood clot in the internal carotid and cerebral arteries, and fatty deposits that can cause blockage of blood flow to the brain\cite{IschemicStroke}}\label{fig:Ischemic_Stroke}
  \end{figure}

  \item \textbf{Hemorrhagic Stroke:}
  According to Andrei V. Alexandrov and Balaji Krishnaiah~\cite{HemorrhagicStroke}, ``When blood vessels of the brain are weak, abnormal, or under unusual pressure, a hemorrhagic stroke can occur. In hemorrhagic strokes, bleeding may occur within the brain, as an intracerebral hemorrhage. Or bleeding may occur between the inner and middle layer of tissue covering the brain (in the subarachnoid space), as a subarachnoid hemorrhage`` (see Figure~\ref{fig:HemorrhagicStroke}).
  

  Hemorrhagic strokes are further classified into two main types~\cite{Stroke}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Intracerebral Hemorrhage: } Occurs when a blood vessel within the brain bursts, leading to bleeding into the brain tissue. Common causes include hypertension and cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
    \item \textbf{Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: } Bleeding occurs in the subarachnoid space, often due to ruptured aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{HemorrhagicStroke}
    \caption{Illustration of a haemorrhagic stroke, showing intracerebral haemorrhage (bleeding inside the brain) and subarachnoid haemorrhage (bleeding in the subarachnoid space)\cite{HemorrhagicStroke}}\label{fig:HemorrhagicStroke}
  \end{figure}
  \item \textbf{Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Often called a mini-stroke, a TIA is a temporary period of symptoms similar to those of a stroke. It doesn’t cause permanent damage and is caused by a temporary decrease in blood supply to part of the brain. TIAs are significant predictors of future strokes and should be taken seriously~\cite{Stroke,Epidemiologyofstroke}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}




\subsection{Diagnosis}
\label{sec:diagnosisstroke}
Advanced imaging methods and clinical evaluation are combined in the diagnosis of stroke:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Clinical Evaluation:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item To determine the start, nature, and severity of symptoms, a comprehensive history and neurological examination are part of the initial evaluation ~\cite{Epidemiologyofstroke}.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Imaging Methodologies:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Computed Tomography (CT) scan:} The first imaging test used to distinguish between hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke is usually a non-contrast CT scan. It can also aid in ruling out other brain disorders that might resemble the symptoms of a stroke~\cite{Stroke}. 
  \item \textbf{Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):} Provides more detailed images of brain tissue compared to CT scans and is particularly useful in detecting ischemic strokes in the early stages. Diffusion-weighted MRI is more sensitive in detecting early ischemic changes and can help in identifying the exact location and extent of the infarct~\cite{Stroke}.
  \item \textbf{Carotid Ultrasound:} Used to assess blood flow in the carotid arteries and to identify blockages or narrowing that could lead to a stroke~\cite{Stroke}.
  \item \textbf{Cerebral Angiography:} An invasive procedure that involves injecting a contrast dye into the brain's blood vessels to visualize them on X-ray images, helping to identify aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and other vascular anomalies~\cite{Stroke1}.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Additional Tests:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Blood Tests:} These may include complete blood count, coagulation profile, and blood glucose levels to identify any underlying conditions that might have contributed to the stroke~\cite{Stroke}.
  \item \textbf{Cardiac Evaluation:} Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography are used to detect potential cardiac sources of emboli, such as atrial fibrillation or valvular heart disease~\cite{Stroke}.
\end{itemize}  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Effects and Complications of Stroke}
\label{sec:effectandcomplicationssofstroke}
\subsubsection{Effects of Stroke}
\label{sec:effectsofstroke}
When an ischemic stroke happens, the most major loss of function usually happens right away. However, 15–25\% of strokes develop over a day or two, resulting in a more significant loss of function. Within minutes to hours, hemorrhagic strokes can result in a progressive loss of function. 


Because of brain plasticity, which occurs over time and allows other brain regions to compensate for injured ones, some recovery may be possible. 


Early consequences like paralysis, however, have the potential to become irreversible, resulting in tight and spastic muscles as well as challenges with speaking, walking, swallowing, and daily activities.


 Memory loss, concentration problems, depression, and other emotional and cognitive disorders may not go away~\cite{OverviewofStroke}.
 \subsubsection{Complications of Stroke}
 \label{sec:complicationsofstroke}
 Severe strokes can result in increased intracranial pressure and brain swelling, which can induce a brain herniation. 
 This can impair breathing and awareness and even put a person in a coma or cause death. 
 
 
 Complications from stroke symptoms include dehydration, undernourishment, pressure sores, muscle atrophy, contractures, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, urinary tract infections, and aspiration pneumonia brought on by difficulty eating~\cite{OverviewofStroke}.
\subsection{Treatment}
\label{sec:tretamentstroke}


Thanks to developments in medical technology and our growing understanding of the pathophysiology of strokes, the treatment of strokes has changed dramatically over the past several decades. Stroke therapy options are roughly categorized as acute management, secondary prevention, and rehabilitation. 

\subsubsection{Acute Management}
\label{sec:acutemanagement}
The major goal during the acute phase of stroke treatment is to restore cerebral blood flow as soon as possible. The primary treatment for acute ischemic stroke remains thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). When given within a short window of 3 to 4.5 hours following the onset of symptoms, rt-PA can considerably lessen neurological damage by dissolving the blood clot clogging the cerebral artery.


However, the use of rt-PA is limited due to rigorous eligibility requirements and the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. As a result, this treatment benefits only a limited number of patients.


In addition to rt-PA, mechanical thrombectomy has become a standard treatment for major vascular occlusions. This procedure involves physically removing the clot with stent retrievers and is most effective when performed within 6 hours of symptom onset~\cite{Therapeuticstrategies}.

\subsubsection{Intensive Stroke Units}
\label{sec:intstrokeunits}
Intensive Stroke Units (ISUs) are a novel approach to stroke therapy, offering patients a dedicated environment in which they get thorough and ongoing care. These units are staffed by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists, resulting in better patient outcomes such as lower mortality rates and shorter hospital stays~\cite{Treatment_of_stroke_on_an_intensive_stroke_unit}.

\subsubsection{Secondary Prevention}
\label{sec:secondaryprevention}
Preventing recurrent strokes is an important aspect of stroke therapy. This includes addressing modifiable risk factors such hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. 


Secondary prevention options for cardioembolic stroke include antiplatelet treatment, anticoagulation, and lifestyle adjustments. 


Carotid ultrasonography is commonly used to diagnose carotid artery stenosis, which can be treated surgically by carotid endarterectomy or stenting to lower the risk of future strokes~\cite{Stroke}.

\subsubsection{Rehabilitation}
\label{sec:rehabilitation}
Rehabilitation begins as soon as the patient is medically stable, usually within the first 24-48 hours of hospitalization. A multidisciplinary approach that includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology is critical for maximizing functional rehabilitation and encouraging independence. 


The goal of rehabilitation is to improve motor skills, cognitive functions, and everyday activity abilities in stroke survivors, hence improving their overall quality of life~\cite{Treatment_of_stroke_on_an_intensive_stroke_unit}.

\subsection{Importance of Physiotherapy in Stroke Rehabilitation}
\label{sec:physiotherapy}
Physiotherapy is a critical component of stroke patients rehabilitation, helping them regain function, increase their range of motion, and generally improve their quality of life. 

The process of rehabilitation is intricate and multidimensional, incorporating a range of methods and strategies catered to the individual requirements of every patient.

\subsubsection{Improving Functional Recovery}
\label{sec:improvingfunctionalrecovery}
Physiotherapy's main objective in stroke recovery is to maximize function restoration. To do this, intensive physical treatment is especially beneficial.


Higher intensity physical therapy sessions have been linked to improved functional outcomes, according to studies. 


Compared to patients receiving conventional care, patients receiving more frequent and intensive therapy show considerable increases in mobility and total functional ability~\cite{Physiotherapy_after_stroke}. 
This emphasizes how crucial it is to offer therapy at a sufficient intensity in order to optimize recovery potential.

\subsubsection{Long-Term Benefits and Persistent Enhancements}
\label{sec:long-termbenefitsandpersistentenhancements}
For stroke survivors, ongoing physiotherapy offers long-term advantages. Sustaining and improving the progress made during the early period of recovery is facilitated by ongoing rehabilitation activities. 


The necessity of ongoing rehabilitation even in the later stages of recovery has been emphasized by meta-analyses that show sustained physiotherapy interventions result in prolonged improvements in physical activity and decreased disability levels~\cite{Efficacy_of_physiotherapy}. 

\subsubsection{Neuroplasticity and Recovery}
\label{sec:neuroplasticityandrecovery}
The idea that the brain can rearrange itself by generating new neural connections is known as neuroplasticity, and physiotherapy makes use of this. This is especially crucial for stroke recovery since specific workouts and activities can help restore lost skills and boost brain activity. 


Physiotherapy improves neuroplasticity through targeted, repetitive exercise, which improves recovery~\cite{A_Review_of_Stroke_Rehabilitation_and_Physiotherapy}.

\subsubsection{Variety of Techniques and Approaches}
\label{sec:varietyoftechniquesandapproaches}
Various physiotherapy methods support the healing process in different ways. Physiotherapists have embraced the Bobath paradigm, which emphasizes supporting normal movement patterns. Effective stroke rehabilitation practices are built around this strategy and eclectic approaches that incorporate ideas from other ways~\cite{Physiotherapy_treatment_for_stroke_patients}. 


Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that interventions targeted at increasing physical activity, like exercise training, greatly improve physical fitness and the capacity to carry out everyday tasks~\cite{Efficacy_of_interventions_aimed_at_improving_physical_activity}.

\section{Self-Management in Stroke Rehabilitation}
\label{sec:selfmanagement}
Escrever aqui alguma coisa  

\subsection{Definition of Self-Management}
\label{sec:definitionofselfmanagement}
Self-management in healthcare refers to the active participation of patients in managing their symptoms, treatments, physical and psychosocial consequences and lifestyle changes associated with chronic illnesses. 


Setting personal goals, monitoring progress, modifying behaviours so that wellbeing can be managed and taking a proactive approach to recovery are all important things that are necessary for people who have survived a stroke. 


Giving patients responsibility for tasks that were previously the responsibility of healthcare professionals gives them the idea that they have more authority and autonomy~\cite{Building_Bridges_between_healthcare_professionals_patients_and_families}.

\subsection{Importance of Self-Management in Stroke Rehabilitation}
\label{sec:importanceofselfmanagement}
Self-management is a fundamental aspect for stroke survivors, having a significant impact on their quality of life and functional independence.


 Appropriate self-management leads to better physical and mental health outcomes, improved functional capabilities and better methods of dealing with long-term effects. It also encourages patients to be more compliant with rehabilitation exercises, thus reducing the risk of complications and reducing the number of hospital readmissions~\cite{Physiotherapy_after_stroke,Experiences_of_self_management_support_following_a_stroke}. 


By taking an active role in their own care, patients are able to achieve better health outcomes and maintain a higher level of independence and quality of life.

\subsection{Elements of effective self-management}
\label{sec:elementesofeffectiveselfmanagement}
Effective self-management programmes for stroke survivors usually include several components~\cite{Building_Bridges_between_healthcare_professionals_patients_and_families,Strategies_for_self_management_support_by_patients_with_stroke}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Personalised care plans:}  Consists of adapting rehabilitation plans so that each individual's needs and capabilities are met.
  \item \textbf{Education:} Giving patients all the information about their current condition and explaining the importance of following their rehabilitation plans.
  \item \textbf{Goal Setting:} Helping patients to set realistic and achievable goals that will allow them to recover.
  \item \textbf{Monitoring and feedback:} Regularly assessing the patient's progress and providing constructive feedback to help them stay on track.
  \item \textbf{Problem-solving skills:} Teaching patients strategies to overcome barriers and manage complications independently.
  \item \textbf{Behavioural change:} Encouraging lifestyle changes that support long-term health and recovery.
  \item \textbf{Support systems:} Involve family members and carers to provide both emotional and practical support.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Autonomy and Social Engagement}
\label{sec:autonomyandsocialengagement}
As well as achieving independence, rehabilitation should also focus on strengthening the patient's autonomy and social involvement. 


Autonomy allows patients to make decisions about their lives, even if they end up needing support to implement them. Social engagement involves building relationships and participating in community activities, which are crucial to the survivor's overall well-being. 


Rehabilitation programmes should aim to balance independence with autonomy and social involvement to improve the quality of life of stroke survivors~\cite{Is_independence_enough}.  

\subsection{Case Studies and Success Indicators}
\label{sec:casestudiesandsuccessindicators}
There is a lot of evidence to support the effectiveness of self-management programmes in improving the outcomes of stroke survivors.


For example, as stated in~\cite{Building_Bridges_between_healthcare_professionals_patients_and_families},  which explores the creation and implementation of a self-management programme for stroke survivors known as Bridges, states that ``Programmes providing self-management support for patients and families are gaining attention and have shown promising outcomes with regards to reducing long-term unmet needs post stroke`` and ``This approach has been well received by stroke survivors, who perceive that Bridges enables them to manage their progress, set goals of a personal nature, and gain greater understanding of recovery post stroke``.

\subsection{Obstacles and Difficulties in Self-Management}
\label{sec:ObstaclesandDifficultiesinSelf-Management}
Stroke survivors often face some challenges and obstacles when it comes to self-management. 


Many of them don't feel prepared for the new responsibilities that are thrust upon them. 
The fact that the support systems these survivors have access to are often inadequate makes their self-management efforts more difficult.


\section{Goal Setting in Physiotherapy for Stroke Rehabilitation}
\label{sec:goalsetting}
fazer intro

\subsection{Importance of Goal Setting in Stroke Rehabilitation}
\label{sec:importanceofgoalsetting}
Goal setting is a fundamental part of effective stroke rehabilitation, as it plays a key role in motivating patients and provides clear direction for both patients and carers. 


Setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (SMART) goals can significantly increase patient commitment and concentration. 


Throughout the rehabilitation process, it provides a systematic path that helps patients monitor their progress and maintain motivation~\cite{Goal_Setting_in_Rehabilitation}.

\subsection{Challenges in Goal Setting}
\label{sec:challengeinggoalsetting}
Despite the benefits of goal setting, there are some challenges that need to be addressed:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Understanding of Terminology:}  Patients often have some difficulty understanding the terminology used in goal setting, especially immediately after a stroke. According to~\cite{Laver2010}, this challenge is due to a limited understanding of recovery processes, which can prevent effective goal setting.
  \item \textbf{Desire to Return to Normal:} Many stroke survivors have a strong desire to return to their pre-stroke state, which can lead to unrealistic goal setting. This can be a barrier to progress and can lead to frustration and disappointment~\cite{Laver2010}.
  \item \textbf{Preparedness to Set Goals:} Readiness to engage in goal-setting varies from patient to patient. Some may need more time to adapt to new circumstances before they can actively participate in setting meaningful goals. This variability means that carers need to be flexible to each patient's situation~\cite{Laver2010}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Strategies to improve goal setting}
\label{sec:strategiestoimprovegoalsetting}
To overcome the challenges of goal setting in stroke rehabilitation, several strategies can be implemented:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Education and Health Literacy:} Providing patients with clear and concise information about their condition and the rehabilitation process can help them better understand the importance of goal setting and the role it plays in their recovery~\cite{Laver2010}.
  \item \textbf{Patient-specific measuring instruments:} Using patient-specific measuring instruments can increase the relevance and clarity of goals. Such instruments help to monitor progress and adjust goals as necessary, thereby increasing patient motivation and commitment~\cite{Stevens2017}.
  \item \textbf{Person-Centered Approaches:} Adopting a person-centered approach to goal setting can help patients set goals that are meaningful and relevant to them. This approach involves actively involving patients in the goal-setting process and considering their individual needs and preferences~\cite{Goal_setting_in_physiotherapy_exploring_a_person_centered_perspective}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Patient Participation in Goal Setting}
\label{sec:patientparticipationingoalsetting}
Patient participation in goal setting is essential for successful stroke rehabilitation. Patients who actively participate in setting their goals are more likely to be motivated and committed to their rehabilitation.


However, many patients feel excluded from this process. The study~\cite{Stroke_Survivors}, found that more than half of stroke survivors were not involved in selecting their post-acute care (PAC) settings and around two-fifths were not involved in defining their rehabilitation goals. 


This lack of involvement can lead to a disconnect between patients' personal recovery goals and the clinical goals set by their healthcare providers. 

\subsection{Integrated Models of Shared Decision-Making}
\label{sec:integratedmodelsofshareddecisionmaking}
An integrated shared decision-making model involves collaboration between patients and healthcare providers to define and achieve rehabilitation goals. This model encourages continuous dialog and the adjustment of objectives based on the patient's progress and changing needs (see Figure~\ref{fig:The goal-based shared decision-making model}).


It has been demonstrated that this strategy enhances patient satisfaction with care, adherence to rehabilitation programs, and overall clinical outcomes.


When patients and doctors work together to set goals, the resulting plans are more likely to be realistic and adapted to the patient's abilities and aspirations~\cite{Goal_Based_Shared_Decision_Making}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

\section{mHealth Applications in Stroke Rehabilitation}
\label{sec:mhealthapplications}
introduction

\subsection{Introduction to mHealth Applications}
\label{sec:introductiontomhealthapplications}
The term ``mHealth``(see this mobile health) describes the application of mobile technologies, including tablets and smartphones, to public health and medical practice.
mHealth is a subcategory of eHealth, which involves the use of electronic technologies to promote health~\cite{Perspectives_on_the_Evolution_of_Mobile_mHealth}.


The great popularity of mobile devices and their constant presence in everyday life has created significant opportunities for integrating these technologies into healthcare services, including the rehabilitation of patients with chronic diseases such as stroke.

\subsection{Evolution of mHealth Technologies}
\label{sec:evolutionofmhealthtechnologies}
The provision of rehabilitation services has been significantly affected by the development of mobile health technology.


%Initially, mHealth applications only had basic functionalities, such as medication and appointment reminders. Over time, these applications have evolved to include more advanced features, such as real-time monitoring of vital signs, remote consultations and interactive rehabilitation exercises.


In the beginning, the main uses of mHealth apps were for basic health monitoring and educational purposes. These apps helped raise awareness and encourage better living by giving people general health advice and information about their illness.


Basic monitoring functionalities, such as recording daily activities and symptoms, were also common, providing a basic level of self-management support.


With the advance of technology, the integration of sensors and portable devices has become a key development in mobile health. 


These devices made it possible to monitor a wide range of health metrics, such as heart rate, physical activity and sleep patterns. This data provided valuable information about patients' health status and allowed for more personalized and effective intervention strategies. 


mHealth apps have also been transformed by the capability of real-time data collection and transmission. Healthcare professionals may get instant updates on patients' health state thanks to real-time monitoring, and they can act quickly if needed. 


The accessibility and convenience of healthcare services have been further enhanced by telehealth features like video consultations. As a result of these capabilities, patients can get care and support continuously, which lessens the need for in-person visits and permits prompt modifications to treatment regimens~\cite{Perspectives_on_the_Evolution_of_Mobile_mHealth}.


mHealth application developers have also added gaming aspects to address patient adherence and incentive difficulties. Features like leaderboards, badges, and points add interest and enjoyment to the recovery process. 


By enhancing the interaction and enjoyment of the treatment process, these components motivate patients to finish their workouts and follow their programs~\cite{Mobile_health_applications_for_improving_physical_function}.


\subsection{Types of mHealth Applications}
\label{sec:typesofmhealthapplications}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Monitoring and Assessment Applications:} These applications are used to monitor and assess patients' health status, track their progress, and provide feedback to healthcare providers. They can include features such as vital sign monitoring, symptom tracking, and activity tracking~\cite{Systematic_Review_of_Mobile_Health_Applications_in_Rehabilitation}.
  \item \textbf{Educational Support Applications:} Educational support applications provide patients with information about their condition, treatment options, and self-management strategies. They can include features such as educational videos, articles, and quizzes. Patients' ability to make well-informed decisions about their health and adhere to treatment plans can both be improved by the knowledge acquired through these applications.~\cite{mHealth_applications_to_support_caregiver_needs}.
  \item \textbf{Physical Rehabilitation Applications:} Physical rehabilitation applications provide patients with exercises and activities to help them improve their physical function and mobility. These applications can include features such as exercise videos, progress tracking, and goal setting. They can be used to support patients in their rehabilitation process and encourage them to adhere to their treatment plans. Studies show that these applications can lead to significant improvements in patients' physical function, resulting in greater independence and quality of life~\cite{Mobile_health_applications_for_improving_physical_function}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Benefits of mHealth Applications}\label{sec:benefitsofmhealthapplications}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Customization and Adaptability:} A major advantage of mHealth apps is the ability to customize rehabilitation programs so that each patient's specific needs are met. Based on the user's success, the programs can automatically modify the exercises' difficulty levels, offering a suitable and progressively harder challenge~\cite{mHealth_Intervention_Applications_for_Adults_Living_With_the_Effects_of_Stroke}. 
  \item \textbf{Assistance for Motivation and Adherence:} For many patients, sticking to rehabilitation regimens is a regular challenge. mHealth apps employ a variety of techniques to maintain patient motivation. These characteristics encourage patients to stick to their recommended workouts and treatments by making rehabilitation a more enjoyable and rewarding activity~\cite{Mobile_health_applications_for_improving_physical_function}.
  \item \textbf{Improved Patient-Healthcare Professional Communication:} mHealth apps help communication between patients and healthcare professionals, allowing for a continuous flow of information. Through text messages, video chats and messaging portals integrated into the apps, patients can communicate symptoms, ask questions and get advice. Continuous communication at this level can result in faster modifications to treatment plans and better problem-solving strategies~\cite{Perspectives_on_the_Evolution_of_Mobile_mHealth}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenges of mHealth Applications}\label{sec:challengesofmhealthapplications}
Implementing mobile health applications presents some challenges. 


Firstly, ensuring data security and privacy is a primary concern, as these apps have to comply with regulations such as GDPR(General Data Protection Regulation) and HIPAA(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) to protect sensitive patient information.

The lack of standardized security guidelines and insufficient security knowledge among developers further complicate this issue~\cite{Challenges_with_developing_secure_mobile_health_applications}.


User-centered challenges, such as usability and accessibility, are also something that should be taken into account when developing these applications. 
To ensure simplicity of use and broad accessibility, applications should be made to accommodate users with varying degrees of digital literacy as well as physical or cognitive limitations~\cite{mHealth_applications_to_support_caregiver_needs}.


Maintaining patient engagement and adherence to rehabilitation programs can also be difficult. 
While gamification and motivational strategies are frequently used in mHealth applications to promote consistent use, sustained long-term engagement necessitates ongoing innovation and user-centered design~\cite{Mobile_health_applications_for_improving_physical_function}.
\subsection{Impact of mHealth Applications in Stroke Rehabilitation}\label{sec:impactofmhealthapplications}
Research indicates that the utilization of mobile health applications during stroke rehabilitation can lead to noteworthy enhancements in the health results of patients. For instance, it has been demonstrated that consistent use of mHealth-based exercise regimens enhances patients' motor function and mobility. 


Moreover, it has been demonstrated that apps offering emotional and cognitive support lower anxiety and sadness, two conditions that are common in stroke survivors~\cite{mHealth_Intervention_Applications_for_Adults_Living_With_the_Effects_of_Stroke}.


\section{Web Application Development Process}\label{sec:webapplicationdevelopment}
Because web apps provide dynamic and interactive platforms for a range of user needs, they have emerged as a critical component of contemporary software engineering. A number of clearly defined processes in this approach guarantee the development of reliable, expandable, and user-friendly applications. 


The essential procedures and best practices to effectively construct a web application from concept to deployment are highlighted in this part, which also covers the major phases of web application development.

\subsection{Development stages}\label{sec:developmentstages}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Planning and Requirements Gathering:}~\cite{Web_Application_Development}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Define the goal:} Recognize the objectives, target market, and business needs of the project.
    \item \textbf{Identifying Stakeholders:} Understanding who the stakeholders are, including end-users, clients, and developers.
    \item \textbf{Gathering Requirements:} Collecting specific requirements from stakeholders through meetings, questionnaires, and interviews. Both functional(features and functionalities)  and non-functional needs are included in this (performance, security, usability).
    Effective planning helps to create a roadmap that can guide the development process, ensuring that all stakeholders clearly understand the project's objectives and constraints~\cite{Ten_simple_rules}.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Design:} The goal of the design phase is to provide a user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) that are both aesthetically pleasing and intuitive:~\cite{Web_Application_Development_A_Step_By_Step}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{UI Design:} The UI design focuses on the visual aspects of the application, such as layout, color scheme, and typography. The goal is to create an attractive and user-friendly interface that enhances the user experience.
    \item \textbf{UX Design:} The UX design focuses on the overall user experience, including how users interact with the application and how easy it is to navigate. The goal is to create a seamless and intuitive experience that meets the needs of the target audience.
  \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Selecting the technologies to be used:} For both frontend and backend development, choosing the appropriate technology stack is essential:~\cite{Web_Application_Development} 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Frontend:} Frontend developers use technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with frameworks like React or Angular to build dynamic user interfaces. 
      \item \textbf{Backend:} Backend developers create the application's server-side functionality using tools like Python, Ruby on Rails, and Node.js.
      \item \textbf{Database:} Since the database stores and retrieves data, it is an essential part of any web application. The database technology selected for a project is determined by its needs, including data structure, performance, and scalability. SQL databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL databases (like MongoDB) can be chosen based on the requirements of the application.
      \item \textbf{Version Control:} Using Git for version control and platforms like GitHub or GitLab for collaboration and code management is essential for web application development.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Development:} During the development phase, the application is constructed in accordance with the specifications and design that were acquired in the earlier stages.
  

  This involves backend development for managing server-side functionality, database interfaces, and APIs, and frontend development for implementing UI designs and guaranteeing responsiveness. 


  It's crucial to guarantee smooth front-end and back-end connection, which is frequently accomplished via GraphQL or RESTful APIs.


  Agile approaches are widely used to support iterative development and regularly integrate input.~\cite{Web_Application_Development}
    
  \item \textbf{Testing:} Testing is a critical phase in the development process that ensures the application's quality and functionality.
    
  
  This covers system testing for the entire program, performance testing under various scenarios, integration testing for diverse sections working together, unit testing for individual components, and security testing to find and address vulnerabilities. 


  This approach is streamlined by continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and automated testing technologies.~\cite{Web_Application_Development_A_Step_By_Step}

  \item \textbf{Deployment:} The application is put into a production environment after it has been tested. This include uploading the application files, selecting a hosting provider, and setting up the server environment. 


  This procedure can be automated and streamlined with CI/CD pipelines, guaranteeing error-free and seamless releases. 
  
  
  It's also critical to implement monitoring tools to track the availability and performance of the application in real-time.~\cite{Web_Application_Development}

  \item \textbf{Maintenance and Updates:} The application needs to be maintained in order to stay current and functional after it is deployed. Performance monitoring, bug fixes, software updates, and the addition of new features as required are all included with this.~\cite{Web_Application_Development}

\label{sec:quick_started}

\subsection{With a Local \LaTeX\ Installation} % (fold)
\label{sub:with_a_local_latex_installation}

Follow these steps to get started with a local \LaTeX\ installation:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Download \LaTeX.  There are two major \LaTeX\ distributions — \href{https://miktex.org/}{\MikTeX} and \href{https://www.tug.org/texlive/}{\TeXLive} — that share lots of similarity, and \LaTeX\ documents are portable between them. This means that, for most users, both systems are equally usable.
  \begin{description}
    \item [\TeX-Live] is maintained by (La)\TeX\ developers and is certainly the best distribution you may install in your computer:  However, the default distribution will take more than 5\,GB on your hard disk… so, if you are not short on disk space, install \TeXLive!
    \item[Mik\TeX] will, by default, install only a minimal set of packages. The extra/additional packages will be installed on the fly.  Installing packages on the fly is useful if disk space is limited, but has its own caveats in the longer term.  Definitely choose \MikTeX\ if you're short on disk space.
  \end{description}
  Which one to download?  There are \href{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/20036/what-are-the-advantages-of-tex-live-over-miktex}{pros and cons for both distributions} so it is essentially a question of where does your heart fall first!  Mine falls to \TeXLive, but yours can fall elsewhere!  \emojiSmile
  \item Install \LaTeX. Installation of \LaTeX\ is as hard as installing any other software.  Just do your best and you will certainly succeed. 
  \item Update your \LaTeX\ installation using the \emph{\TeXLive Utility} program of the \MikTeX\ console.
  \item Download the \gls{novathesis} template by either:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Cloning the \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis}{GitHub repository} with
    \begin{verbatim}    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis.git\end{verbatim}
    or
    \item Downloading the \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis/archive/main.zip}{latest version from the GitHub repository as a Zip file}.
  \end{itemize}

  \item \label{it:project_available} Download additional School specific files if applicable:
  \begin{description}
    \item[Universidade do Minho (UMINHO)] download the required \emph{NewsGotT} font files from
    \url{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis-extras/raw/main/Fonts/NewsGotT.zip}\\
    then unzip the file and copy the~3~font files
\begin{flushleft}
\hspace*{0.5cm}“\verb!n015002t.ttf!”, “\verb!n015003t.ttf!”, and “\verb!n015006t.ttf!”
\end{flushleft}
    to the folder
\begin{flushleft}
\hspace*{0.5cm}“\verb!NOVAthesisFiles/FontStyles/Fonts!”.
\end{flushleft}
    \item[Escola Superior de Enfermagem do Porto (ESEP)] download the required \emph{Calibri} font files from
    \url{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis-extras/raw/main/Fonts/Calibri.zip}\\
    then unzip the file and copy the~4~font files
\begin{flushleft}
\hspace*{0.5cm}“\verb!Calibri.ttf!”, “\verb!Calibrib.ttf!”, “\verb!Calibrii.ttf!”, and “\verb!Calibriz.ttf!”
\end{flushleft}
      \noindent to the folder
\begin{flushleft}
\hspace*{0.5cm}\verb!NOVAthesisFiles/FontStyles/Fonts!.
\end{flushleft}
  \end{description}

  \item Compile the document with you favorite LaTeX processor (pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX).
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The main file is named “\verb!template.tex!”, but you are free to rename it as you please.
    \item Either load the main file in your favorite \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors}{LaTeX text editor} and press the appropriate (\emph{magic}) button to generate a PDF file, or open a terminal and compile it with “\verb!latexmk -pdf template!”. If you use a \LaTeX\ text editor, please notice that the \gls{novathesis} template uses “\verb!biber!” and not “\verb!bibtex!” to process the bibliography, which means that most probably you have to open the \emph{Editor Preferences} and somewhere (depending on the Editor you are using) change “\verb!bibtex!” to “\verb!biber!”.
    \item Notice that, due to the external font sets used, \pdfLaTeX\ will not work for both \textbf{UMINHO} and \textbf{ESEP}, and you have to use either \XeLaTeX\ (“\verb!latexmk -pdfxe template!”) or \LuaLaTeX (“\verb!latexmk -pdflua template!”).
  \end{itemize}
  \item Edit the files in the “Config” folder:
    \bgroup
    \rowcolors{1}{}{GhostWhite}
    \begin{xltabular}{\textwidth}{>{\ttfamily}lX}
        \toprule

1\_novathesis.tex   & Configure the template (e.g., the document type, the school, the languages used, etc.)\\
2\_biblatex.tex     & Select how your citations and bibliographic references will be printed.  The default is numbers inside square brackets, e.g. \cite{novathesis-manual}, but you can change it to other formats, such as author-year, e.g., \citeauthor{novathesis-manual}~(\citeyear{novathesis-manual}).\\
3\_cover.tex        & Configure cover contents (e.g., thesis/dissertation title, author's name, advisers' names, committee members' names, date, etc).\\
4\_files.tex        & Select the files for chapters, appendices, annexes, abstracts, glossaries, etc.\\
5\_packages.tex     & User's customization.  Load additional packages and define your own commands to be used throughout the document.\\
6\_list\_of.tex     & Configure the lists to be printed (table of contents, list of figures, list of tables, list of listings, etc). \emph{Don't touch this file unless you know what you are doing!}\\
9\_nova\_fct.tex    & Configuration specific to NOVA-FCT. Otherwise ignored.\\
9\_nova\_ims.tex    & Configuration specific to NOVA-IMS. Otherwise ignored.\\

        \bottomrule
    \end{xltabular}
    \egroup
    % \end{longtblr}
    \item Recompile de document.
    \item And you're done with a beautifully formatted thesis/dissertation! {\setlength{\twemojiDefaultHeight}{1.5\twemojiDefaultHeight}\emojiSmile}

\subsection{With a Remote Cloud-based Service} % (fold)
\label{sub:with_a_remote_cloud_based_service}

Follow these steps to get started with a remote \LaTeX\ installation:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Download the \href{https://github.com/joaomlourenco/novathesis/archive/main.zip}{latest version from the GitHub repository as a Zip file}.
  \item Login to your favorite LaTeX cloud service. I recommend \href{https://www.overleaf.com/?r=f5160636&rm=d&rs=b}{Overleaf} but there are alternatives. These instructions apply to Overleaf and you'll have to adapt for other providers.
  \item In the menu select \fbox{New project}$\rightarrow$\fbox{Upload project}.
  \item Select “\verb!template.tex!” as the main file.
  \item Follow from Step~\ref{it:project_available} above in Section~\ref{sub:with_a_local_latex_installation} (\nameref{sub:with_a_local_latex_installation}).

\section{Additional considerations about the class options}
\label{sec:additional_considerations}

In this section we will provide some additional considerations about some of the customizations available as class options.

\subsection{The main language}
\label{sub:the_main_language}

The choice of the main language with the option “\texttt{lang=OPT}” affects:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The order of the summaries.} First is printed the abstract in the main language and then in the foreign language. This means that if your main language for the document in English, you will see first the “abstract” (in English) and then the “resumo” (in Portuguese). If you switch the main language for the document for Portuguese, it will also automatically switch the order of the summaries to “resumo” and then “abstract”.
  \item \textbf{The names for document sectioning.} E.g., ``Chapter'' vs.\ ``Capítulo'', ``Table of Contents'' vs.\ ``Índice'', ``Figure'' vs.\ ``Figura'', etc.
  \item \textbf{The type of documents in the bibliography.} E.g., ``Technical Report'' vs.\ ``Relatório Técnico'', ``PhD Thesis'' vs.\ ``Tese de Doutoramento'', etc.
\end{itemize}

No mater which language you chose, you will always have the appropriate hyphenation rules according to the language at that point. You always get Portuguese hyphenation rules in the ``Resumo'', English hyphenation rules in the ``Abstract'', and then the main language hyphenation rules for the rest of the document.

\subsection{Class of Text}
\label{sub:class_of_text}

You must choose the class of text for the document. The available options are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{bsc} --- BSc graduation report.
  \item \textbf{*mscplan} --- Preparation of MSc dissertation. This is a preliminary report graduate students at DI-FCT-NOVA must prepare to conclude the first semester of the two-semesters MSc work. The files specified by \verb!\ntdedicatoryfile! and \verb!\acknowledgmentsfile! are ignored, even if present, for this class of document.
  \item \textbf{msc} --- MSc dissertation.
  \item \textbf{phdprop} ---  Proposal for a PhD work. The files specified by \verb!\ntdedicatoryfile! and \verb!\acknowledgmentsfile! are ignored, even if present, for this class of document.
  \item \textbf{prepphd} ---  Preparation of a PhD thesis. This is a preliminary report PhD students at DI-FCT-NOVA must prepare before the end of the third semester of PhD work. The files specified by \verb!\ntdedicatoryfile! and \verb!\acknowledgmentsfile! are ignored, even if present, for this class of document.
  \item \textbf{phd} --- PhD dissertation.

\section{Example glossary, acronyms, and symbols}
%
% \todo[inline]{A a note in a line by itself.}
%
This is the first occurrence of an abbreviation: \gls{abbrev}. And now the second occurrence of the same abbreviation: \gls{abbrev}. And a new acronym with capital letter: \Gls{xpt} and reused \gls{xpt}.  Let's also use a few other acronyms such as \gls{aaa}, \gls{aab}, \gls{aba}, \gls{bbb} and \gls{xpt}.
In geometry, the area enclosed by a circle of radius \gls{r} is $\pi r^2$. Here the Greek letter \gls{pi} is equal to the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter.
Lets add ``\gls{computer}'' to the glossary! Be carefull with mathematical symbols in acronyms, please see the definition of \gls{mu}.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This chapter describes how to use the \gls{novathesis}\ Template and the \gls{novathesisclass} file.  I will assume you have a working installation of \LaTeX, wither local (in your own computer) or remote (in Overleaf), and that it compiled successfully the default configuration (PhD for \gls{FCT}).


\section{Folder Structure}
\label{sec:folder_structure}

The \gls{novathesis} template is organized into many files and folders. At the main level it includes the following files and folders:

\noindent
\bgroup
\rowcolors{1}{GhostWhite}{}
\begin{xltabular}{\linewidth}{>{\ttfamily}l>{\itshape}l>{\upshape}X}
novathesis.cls     & file    &
The main class file. It will include additional files from \texttt{NOVAthesisFiles} folder and its sub-folders.
\\
template.tex      & file    &
The main template file. You need to \emph{compile} this file with one of pdf\LaTeX, \XeLaTeX, or \LuaLaTeX\ to obtain the \texttt{template.pdf} file.
\\
bibliography.bib  & file    &

\section{Additional considerations about the class options}
\label{sec:additional_considerations}

In this section we will provide some additional considerations about some of the customizations available as class options.

\subsection{The main language}
\label{sub:the_main_language}

The choice of the main language with the option “\texttt{lang=OPT}” affects:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The order of the summaries.} First is printed the abstract in the main language and then in the foreign language. This means that if your main language for the document in English, you will see first the “abstract” (in English) and then the “resumo” (in Portuguese). If you switch the main language for the document for Portuguese, it will also automatically switch the order of the summaries to “resumo” and then “abstract”.
  \item \textbf{The names for document sectioning.} E.g., ``Chapter'' vs.\ ``Capítulo'', ``Table of Contents'' vs.\ ``Índice'', ``Figure'' vs.\ ``Figura'', etc.
  \item \textbf{The type of documents in the bibliography.} E.g., ``Technical Report'' vs.\ ``Relatório Técnico'', ``PhD Thesis'' vs.\ ``Tese de Doutoramento'', etc.
\end{itemize}

No mater which language you chose, you will always have the appropriate hyphenation rules according to the language at that point. You always get Portuguese hyphenation rules in the ``Resumo'', English hyphenation rules in the ``Abstract'', and then the main language hyphenation rules for the rest of the document.

\subsection{Class of Text}
\label{sub:class_of_text}

You must choose the class of text for the document. The available options are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{bsc} --- BSc graduation report.
  \item \textbf{*mscplan} --- Preparation of MSc dissertation. This is a preliminary report graduate students at DI-FCT-NOVA must prepare to conclude the first semester of the two-semesters MSc work. The files specified by \verb!\ntdedicatoryfile! and \verb!\acknowledgmentsfile! are ignored, even if present, for this class of document.
  \item \textbf{msc} --- MSc dissertation.
  \item \textbf{phdprop} ---  Proposal for a PhD work. The files specified by \verb!\ntdedicatoryfile! and \verb!\acknowledgmentsfile! are ignored, even if present, for this class of document.
  \item \textbf{prepphd} ---  Preparation of a PhD thesis. This is a preliminary report PhD students at DI-FCT-NOVA must prepare before the end of the third semester of PhD work. The files specified by \verb!\ntdedicatoryfile! and \verb!\acknowledgmentsfile! are ignored, even if present, for this class of document.
  \item \textbf{phd} --- PhD dissertation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Printing}
\label{sub:printing}

You must choose how your document will be printed. The available options are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{oneside} --- Single side page printing.
  \item \textbf{*twoside} --- Double sided page printing.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Font Size}
\label{ssec:font_size}

You must select the encoding for your text. The available options are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{11pt} --- Eleven (11) points font size.
  \item \textbf{*12pt} --- Twelve (12) points font size. You should really stick to 12pt\ldots
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Text Encoding}
\label{ssec:text_encoding}

You must choose the font size for your document. The available options are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{latin1} --- Use Latin-1 (\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1}{ISO 8859-1}) encoding.  Most probably you should use this option if you use Windows;
  \item \textbf{utf8} --- Use \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8}{UTF8} encoding.    Most probably you should use this option if you are not using Windows.

Let's have a look at a couple of examples:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Preparation of PhD thesis, in portuguese, with 11pt size and to be printed single sided (I wonder why one would do this!)\\
  \verb!\documentclass[prepphd,pt,11pt,oneside,latin1]{thesisdifct-nova}!
  \item MSc dissertation, in English, with 12pt size and to be printed double sided\\
  \verb!\documentclass[msc,en,12pt,twoside,utf8]{thesisdifct-nova}!
\end{itemize}

\section{How to Write Using \LaTeX}
\label{sec:how_to_write_using_latex}

Please have a look at Chapter~\ref{cha:a_short_latex_tutorial_with_examples}, where you may find many examples of \LaTeX constructs, such as Sectioning, inserting Figures and Tables, writing Equations, Theorems and algorithms, exhibit code listings, etc.

\section{Example glossary, acronyms, and symbols}
%
% \todo[inline]{A a note in a line by itself.}
%
This is the first occurrence of an abbreviation: \gls{abbrev}. And now the second occurrence of the same abbreviation: \gls{abbrev}. And a new acronym with capital letter: \Gls{xpt} and reused \gls{xpt}.  Let's also use a few other acronyms such as \gls{aaa}, \gls{aab}, \gls{aba}, \gls{bbb} and \gls{xpt}.
In geometry, the area enclosed by a circle of radius \gls{r} is $\pi r^2$. Here the Greek letter \gls{pi} is equal to the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter.
Lets add ``\gls{computer}'' to the glossary! Be carefull with mathematical symbols in acronyms, please see the definition of \gls{mu}.
